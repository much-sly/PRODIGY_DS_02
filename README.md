# TITANIC DATASET ANALYSIS
The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that famously sank on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City in April 1912 after striking an iceberg. It was the largest and most luxurious ship of its time, designed to offer unmatched comfort and safety. Despite its advanced safety features, the Titanic lacked enough lifeboats for all passengers, which contributed to the tragic loss of over 1,500 lives.

In analyzing the Titanic dataset, I explored and categorized data on passengers, including their age, class, and survival status. I handled missing age values by filling them with "Not Given"  and 'not specified' for other columns and created age groups to better understand the distribution of ages on the ship. Additionally, I visualized the data using bar plots to represent passenger classes and survival counts, helping to uncover insights into the demographics and survival patterns of those aboard the ill-fated voyage.

## METHODOLOGY
1. Importing the Data

2. Data Preprocessing

3. Data Wrangling

4. Exploratory Data Analysis.

## CONCLUSIONS.
Most of the people on board were adults which I categorised between ages 18-40. Below is a plot that shows the disribution of age groups within the entire dataset.

Additionally I uncovered that the survival rate for females was higher than that of females showing that their survival was prioritised. Below is the plot that shows that information
